# AMSKY01

All-in-one Sky Quality, Cloud & Environment Sensor

AMSKY is a versatile, all-in-one sensor for astronomers and observatories. It measures sky brightness, detects cloud coverage using advanced sky temperature measurement, and provides ambient temperature and humidity readings.
With both USB (CDC serial) and RS485 interfaces, AMSKY01 can be easily connected to computers, automation controllers, or building management systems. Designed for permanent installations, AMSKY01 delivers all essential environmental data for night sky observation, light pollution monitoring, and observatory automation — in a single, robust device.

### Key Features

 * Sky Brightness Measurement Real-time readings in magnitudes per square arcsecond (mag/arcsec²) for objective light pollution assessment.
 * Cloud Coverage Detection Dedicated sky temperature sensor (thermal IR) for fast cloud presence and sky clarity evaluation.
 * Ambient Temperature & Humidity High-accuracy, calibrated sensors monitor local environmental conditions.
 * Dual Interface: USB & RS485 Plug-and-play via USB-C (CDC serial) for computers, or RS485 for direct integration with observatory or building automation systems (BMS/SCADA).
 * Open Protocol & API Fully documented for custom integration and automation.
 * Weatherproof & Durable Rugged enclosure for outdoor and permanent installations.

### Typical Applications
 * Monitoring and documenting light pollution and sky quality.
 * Automated cloud detection for remote or robotic observatories.
 * Integration into building management and dome automation systems via RS485.
 * Environmental monitoring for astronomy and meteorological networks.
 * Citizen science and research projects.
